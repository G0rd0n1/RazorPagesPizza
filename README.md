# RazorPagesPizza

## Create a web UI with ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core supports creating webpages using a native templating engine called Razor. 
I learnt how to create web pages using Razor with ASP.NET Core. I created a basic application with a Navigation bar.
In this Navbar I created a 'Pizza List' link which takes you to a form that supports the app's product data management requirements.
